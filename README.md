# Weather

This is an app using Ruby, Hanami https://hanamirb.org and OpenWeatherMap https://openweathermap.org/api to display the temperature for a given city in fahrenheit.

## Getting started

This app uses OpenWeatherMap and requires an API key to run. To run this app locally add your API key to the `.env.development` file:

```

```

```

How to run the development server:

```

How to prepare (create and migrate) DB for `development` and `test` environments:

% HANAMI_ENV=test bundle exec hanami db prepare
```
